<i> KD6-3.7 is a character in the Blade Runner universe whose job is to catch old replicant models that can be 
identified by their ID number </i>

## About

Every person is given an identification number at birth, when they reach a certain age or status, which allows them to 
be distinguished from other people. As it turned out, in many countries different identification numbers are generated 
by state authorities not by chance, but according to a certain algorithm. 

**KD6-3.7** knows these algorithms and is able to provide additional information about a person if you have his/her 
identification number. This method can be useful in OSINT investigations when there is not much information about a 
person.

At the moment you can see additional information about ID number holders from the following countries:

- Albania
- Belgium
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Bulgaria
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Slovakia

The list of countries and features will be added over time!
